# Jac Cloud 😶‍🌫️

Jac Cloud is a powerful cloud-native framework that transforms your Jac applications into production-ready API servers with minimal configuration. Simply replace `jac run` with `jac serve` to transform your application into a fully-featured web service.

### 🔐 Authenticate.jac

The program successfully connects my login/signup UI to my defined Jac sign_up and login walker APIs, and integrated Jac-Cloud with MongoDB to ensure that user data persists across sessions and system restarts/shutdown. [code](https://github.com/MithamoMorgan/Building-Generative-AI-Applications/blob/main/Scale_Agnostic/authenticate.jac).

### 🛒 Requirements
1. `jac-cloud`
2. `MongoDB`- install and must be running locally with a replica set enabled for jac-cloud persistence
3. `Browser` - To opne `index.html` and `home.html`

### 🚀 Run
* Make sure MongoDB is running
* Serve your jac application-  `jac serve authenticate.jac`
