# Week 2
This morning, I converted last week’s project, diagnosis.jac, into a server application by turning the Doctor walker into a REST API endpoint that can be accessed by other software programs. This means the medical diagnosis logic can now be integrated with web or mobile applications for broader use. [code](https://github.com/MithamoMorgan/Building-Generative-AI-Applications/blob/main/Week2_Project/server.jac)

By the end of this week, my goal is to build a complete web application powered by the above Jac REST API.
Instead of using Streamlit for the user interface, I plan to integrate modern web technologies — including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap — to create a more interactive and professional front end.

### Run the code
```bash
jac serve server.jac
```
