# Week 2
This morning, I converted last weekâ€™s project, diagnosis.jac, into a server application by turning the Doctor walker into a REST API endpoint that can be accessed by other software programs. This means the medical diagnosis logic can now be integrated with web or mobile applications for broader use.
