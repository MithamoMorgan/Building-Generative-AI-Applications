# About

In this project I build **Codebase Genius**: an AI‑powered, multi‑agent system 
that automatically generates high‑quality documentation for any software repository, ie an autonomous system that, given a public GitHub repository URL, produces high‑quality markdown documentation of that codebase with clear prose and explanatory diagrams.
