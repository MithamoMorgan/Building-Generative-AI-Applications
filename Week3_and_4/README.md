# Week 3 & 4 📆

## 1. Farmer’s Plant & Animal Diagnosis Chatbot 👨‍🌾

I have successfully developed a chatbot that currently runs via the command line (CLI) to assist farmers with diagnosing plant and animal pests and diseases, as well as providing agricultural tips and advice. This chatbot is specialized and focused solely on farming-related queries, rather than general-purpose conversation.

## 2. Farmer’s Plant & Animal Diagnosis API Server 🌐

Secondly I have converted the chatbot above into a Jac walker exposed as a REST API endpoint that can be connected to a user interface (UI).Here is the [code](https://github.com/MithamoMorgan/Building-Generative-AI-Applications/blob/main/Week3_and_4/farmer_chatbot_server.jac)

### Improvements 🛠️

* Develop a user-friendly interface (UI) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easier interaction.

* Add a feature to upload photos, allowing farmers to submit images of affected plants or animals for more accurate diagnosis.

## 3. Login/Signup System with Jac API and MongoDB Integration🔒🗝️

* Here is the project [page](https://github.com/MithamoMorgan/Building-Generative-AI-Applications/tree/main/Scale_Agnostic_Mini_Project)

## 4 Updated Farmer’s Plant & Animal Diagnosis Chatbot 👨‍🌾

* Here I updated the chatbot such that it has conversation memory to maintain context.Here is the [code](https://github.com/MithamoMorgan/Building-Generative-AI-Applications/blob/main/Week3_and_4/chatbot.jac).
* I also did the same for the walker API endpoint. Here is the [code](https://github.com/MithamoMorgan/Building-Generative-AI-Applications/blob/main/Week3_and_4/chatbot_server.jac).
