# Week 3 & 4 📆

## 1. Farmer’s Plant & Animal Diagnosis Chatbot 👨‍🌾

I have successfully developed a chatbot that currently runs via the command line (CLI) to assist farmers with diagnosing plant and animal pests and diseases, as well as providing agricultural tips and advice. This chatbot is specialized and focused solely on farming-related queries, rather than general-purpose conversation.

### Improvements 🛠️

* Develop a user-friendly interface (UI) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easier interaction.

* Add a feature to upload photos, allowing farmers to submit images of affected plants or animals for more accurate diagnosis.

## 2. Login/Signup System with Jac API and MongoDB Integration🔒🗝️

* Here is the project [page](https://github.com/MithamoMorgan/Building-Generative-AI-Applications/tree/main/Scale_Agnostic)
