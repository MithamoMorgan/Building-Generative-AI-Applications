# 🚀 Building Generative AI Applications

## 📖 Overview
This repository houses the **building of Generative AI Applications** in the **Jaseci Ecosystem**.

---

## 🤔 What is the Jaseci Ecosystem?
Jaseci serves as the **implementation stack for the Jac programming language**.  
It’s packaged as a simple Python library, allowing Jac code to execute with enhanced features while maintaining **seamless Python interoperability** — making it particularly accessible to Python developers. 🐍✨

## 💡 What is Jac?
**Jac** is a new kind of programming language built on top of Python.  
You can still use your Python code and tools, but Jac adds new features that make programming **easier and smarter**, especially for modern tasks like **AI development**. 🤖

Jac helps you:
- ⚡ **Avoid complex code** by hiding the hard parts.
- 🚀 **Build software faster** by automating things you usually have to code manually.
- 🤝 **Work smoothly with Python**, so you don’t have to start from scratch.

Jac also allows you to **easily use large language models (LLMs)** like GPT in your code.  
This replaces complicated code with a simple LLM call, eliminating the need for detailed prompt creation or extra libraries. 🧠💬

## 📂 Structure
Each week of the seminar has its own folder with project files and a dedicated `README.md`.  
- [Week 1](Week1_Project/README.md) – Diagnosis project  
- [Week 2](Week2_Project/README.md) – Converting diagnosis Project program into a server API  
- [Week3&4](https://github.com/MithamoMorgan/Building-Generative-AI-Applications/tree/main/Week3_and_4)- 2 mini_projects(CLI chatbot & Login/Signup Server API).
