# Building-Generative-AI-Applications

### Overview

This repository houses building of Gen AI Applications in Jaseci Ecosystem.

### What is Jaseci Ecosystem?

Jaseci serves as the implementation stack for the Jac programming language, and is packaged as a simple Python library. This runtime stack enables Jac code to execute with its enhanced features while maintaining the seamless Python interoperability that makes the language particularly accessible to Python developers.

### What is Jac?

Jac is a new kind of programming language. It's built on top of Python, so you can still use Python code and tools with it. But Jac adds some new features that make programming easier and smarter, especially for modern tasks like AI development.

It helps you:

1. Avoid complex code by hiding the hard parts.</br>

2. Build software faster by automating things you usually have to code by hand.</br>

3. Work smoothly with Python, so you donâ€™t have to start from scratch.</br>

Jac allows you to easily use large language models (like GPT) in your code by replacing complicated code with a call to the LLM. This simplifies the process, eliminating the need for detailed prompt creation or using extra libraries to make the LLM work.

### Week 1 Assignment

I have successfully built a medical diagnosis program in jac that has 4 nodes namely, Patient, Age, Gender, and Symptoms where Patient is the parent node.
