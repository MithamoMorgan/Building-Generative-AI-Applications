# Jac Cloud 😶‍🌫️

Jac Cloud is a powerful cloud-native framework that transforms your Jac applications into production-ready API servers with minimal configuration. Simply replace `jac run` with `jac serve` to transform your application into a fully-featured web service.

### 🔐 Authenticate.jac

The program successfully connects a login/signup UI to my defined Jac sign_up and login walker APIs, and integrated Jac-Cloud with MongoDB to ensure that user data persists across sessions and system restarts.
