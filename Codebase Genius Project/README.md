# AboutðŸ’¡

In this project I build **Codebase Genius**: an AIâ€‘powered, **multiâ€‘agent** system 
that automatically generates highâ€‘quality documentation for any software repository, ie an autonomous system that, given a public GitHub repository URL, produces highâ€‘quality markdown documentation of that codebase with clear prose and explanatory diagrams.

# To Know ðŸ§ 

#### Q. What is an agent?

An agent is a self-contained unit(node or walker) that: Perceives its environment (gets input or data),Thinks or decides what to do (processes logic or uses an AI model), Acts to achieve specific goals (executes actions or produces outputs).

#### Q. What is a multi-agent system?

A system made up of multiple intelligent agents that can interact, collaborate, or coordinate with each other to achieve specified goals.

# Agents

1. `Supervisor`: Required for coordination and control ie, orchestrates the workflow, receives GitHub URL, delegates tasks.
   
2. `Repo Mapper`: Clones repo + generates file tree + summarizes README. Gives structure and overview for next steps.
   
3. `Code Analyzer`: Adds core code understanding. Reads files (eg  `.jac`, `.py`) and extracts function/class names.
   
4. `DocGenie`: Combines outputs into a Markdown summary ie Produces visible results.
