# AboutðŸ’¡

In this project I build **Codebase Genius**: an AIâ€‘powered, **multiâ€‘agent** system 
that automatically generates highâ€‘quality documentation for any software repository, ie an autonomous system that, given a public GitHub repository URL, produces highâ€‘quality markdown documentation of that codebase with clear prose and explanatory diagrams.
